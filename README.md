### P4 The Animation Portraits - By [hellkrai](https://gamebanana.com/members/1559466)
Replaces the poorly-upscaled dungeon portraits with HD artwork from Persona 4 The Animation.

### Detailed Descriptions = By [rudiger_gb](https://gamebanana.com/members/1491857)
In Persona 4 Golden, there are a number of descriptions and "info" boxes that either don't tell you anything useful, or present information in an unhelpfully abstract way. This mod aims to correct that.
