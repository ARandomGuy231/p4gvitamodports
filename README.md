A repository of P4G PC mods which have been ported to Vita


### Can't find what you're looking for?
If the mod you are looking for is not here. Either we haven't ported it, **OR** it works **WITHOUT** needing to be ported. You can find a list of those mods [here](https://github.com/ARandomGuy231/p4gvitamodports/blob/main/Mods%20that%20work%20without%20needing%20a%20Port.md)

### P4 The Animation Portraits - By [hellkrai](https://gamebanana.com/members/1559466)
Replaces the poorly-upscaled dungeon portraits with HD artwork from Persona 4 The Animation.
The portraits came from the anime's Blu-ray box art and have been carefully tweaked to fit P4G's UI.
